ðŸ•’ Time Complexity

-> Outer Loop: Iterates through all possible eating speeds from 1 to max(piles). Let m = max(piles). This results in O(m) iterations.
->Inner Computation: For each speed k, the total_hours function computes the total hours needed by iterating over all n piles, leading to O(n) operations per iteration.
-> Overall Time Complexity: Combining both, the total time complexity is O(n * m).
This can be inefficient, especially when max(piles) is large.

ðŸ§  Space Complexity

-> Auxiliary Space: The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for variables like low, high, result, and loop counters.
-> Overall Space Complexity: O(1) (excluding the input list piles).
