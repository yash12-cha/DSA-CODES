'''
ðŸ•’ Time Complexity

-> Binary Search Iterations: In each iteration, the algorithm halves the search space by comparing the target with the middle element and determining which half is properly sorted. This results in a logarithmic number of iterations.
-> Overall Time Complexity: O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
This efficiency stems from the binary search mechanism, which consistently reduces the search interval by half.

ðŸ§  Space Complexity
-> Auxiliary Space: The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for variables like low, high, and mid.
-> Overall Space Complexity: O(1) The search is conducted in place without utilizing additional data structures.
